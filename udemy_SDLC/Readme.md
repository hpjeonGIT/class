- Introduction to Citizen Development
  - https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer
  - A citizen developer is an employee who creates application capabilities for consumption by themselves or others, using tools that are not actively forbidden by IT or business units. A citizen developer is a persona, not a title or targeted role. They report to a business unit or function other than IT.

## Project Phases and Roles

- Project Phases
  - Planning: Project Manager
    - Team
    - Stakeholders
    - Timeline
    - Budget
    - Scope
  - Requirements: Business Analyst
    - Problem definition
    - Root cause analysis
    - Documentation
    - Solution ideation
  - Design: Architect
    - Application components
    - Integrations
    - Reusability
    - Resiliency
    - Data model
  - Develop: Developer
    - Build solution
  - Testing: Quality Assurance
    - Types of tests needed
    - Create test cases
    - Coordinate testing
    - Execute/aggregate results
  - Deployment: Deployment manager
    - Plan deployment
    - Rollback options
    - Execute deployment
    - Deployment testing
  - Maintenance: Everyone
    - Monitor code
    - Break/fix
    - Enhancement

- Why project phases matter to a Developer?
  - It helps the developer see the bigger picture and understand what they need to do

- Role: Project Manager
  - Project Knowledge Traffic cops
  - Monitoring flow of data/activity
  - Indentifies risks and plans mitigations
  - Removes roadblocks for team
  - 90% of their job is communication
  - Interacts closely with all teams
  - Often highly experienced

- Role: Business Analyst
  - Project Interpreter (translator)
  - Translates SME needs to requirements
  - Communicates requirements to development
  - Communicates requirements to Quality Assurance
  - Works closely with SMEs
  - Probes needs to elicit true rquirements
  - Designs solutions

- Role: Quality Assurance
  - No bad code shall pass
  - Works closely with Business Analyst on need
  - Leads the efforts to test SW for bug/issue identification and satisfaction of requirements
    - Reactive component of QA
  - Guides for all roles on how to build quality into their processes
    - Checklists, document formats, etc
    - Proactive component of QA

- Role: Architect
  - Designers
    - Big picture view of SW
    - Perspective from the sum of its parts
  - Deep experts in the technology being used, and usually in technology in general
  - Architect usually will cover:
    - HW environment
    - SW modularity
    - Data model
    - And more...

- Role: Developer
  - Builds application (or part)
  - Works closely with the Business Analyst to understand "need"
  - Works with Architect on design

- Role: Stakeholders
  - Anyone who can impact or be impacted by your project
  - Might be internal/external to your company
  - How to identify stakeholders:
    - Who will be using this SW?
    - Who uses SW this is replacing?
    - Will this SW change business processes (add/remove roles)?
    - Any legal/regulatory compliance needs?
    - Who has decision making authority on scope?
    - Who needed for this project to succeed?
    - Any opponents to this project?

- Stakeholder Management
  - Stakeholder types: power vs interest
    - Low power/low interest: monitor
    - High power/low interest: Keep satisfied
    - Low power/high interest: Keep informed
    - High power/high interest: Monitor closely. Periodic meeting.
  - Stakeholder types: Salience model

## SDLC Methodologies

- Waterfall Introduction
  - ## Screen shot 0:45
  - Was default/dominate SW development approach as little as 20 years ago
  - Well defined and detailed methodology
  - Clear roles and responsibilities
  - Teams mostly work independent of each other
  - Focus on documentation and Phase Gates
  - Completeness Mindset

- Waterfall Roles
  - Project manager
    - Traffic cop
    - 90% of their job is communication
  - Stakeholders
    - Any business leader who will be impacted by the project
  - Subject Matter Experts
    - User's expert in their domain
    - Knowledge givers
  - Business Analysts
    - Gathers and documents requirements
    - Knowledge receivers
  - Dev/Architect
    - System design and build
  - Quality Assurance
    - Design quality through process
    - Coordinate or execute testing

- Waterfall Pros and Cons
  - Pros
    - Clear structure
    - Goals defined early
    - Information transfer well
  - Cons
    - Change is difficult
    - Testing is only at the end
    - Excludes customers and users until near the end
    - Could run out of money with nothing built
- Works best when:
  - Project is highly repeatable
  - Scope is well understood
  - Scope is inflexible

- Interpretations Problem

- Agile Introduction
  - Began around 2000 and now it is dominant approach for SW development currently
  - Sprint based usually 2weeks
    - Cutting down interpretation
    - Project must be decomposed so each piece can be done in 2weeks
  - Loose framework of 'ideas'
  - Integrated teams
  - Focus on solutions and people
  - Continuous improvement mindset

- Agile Roles
  - Scrum Master
    - Removes roadblocks
    - Servant leader
  - Stakeholders
    - Any business leader who will be impacted by the project
  - Product owners
    - User's expert in the domain
    - Knowledge givers
  - Business Analysts
    - Gather and document requirements
    - Knowledge receivers
  - Developers/Architects
    - System design and build
  - Quality Assurance
    - Design quality through process
    - Coordinate or execute testing
  - Roles and Team size is not always one-to-one. Some projects one person will fill multiple roles, other may have multiple people in a single role. This is true for both Agile and Waterfall

- Agile Manifesto
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working SW over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

- Agile Concepts
  - User stories
    - BA works wtih Product owner to create incremental functions
    - Document is lite but augmented with discussions right before developing
  - Standup Daily meetings
    - 3 thigns to discuss: Done, planned, roadblocks, 10-20min
  - Incremental Development
    - Each sprint the product owner prioritized most important items
    - Focused on maximum value in a sprint
  - Retrospective
    - Review what worked, what didn't for continuous improvement

- Agile Pros and Cons
  - Pros
    - Change is easy
    - Includes end users throughout (customers/users)
    - Each sprint delivers working code
    - Continuous improvement
  - Cons
    - Limited documentation
    - Scope unpredictable
    - Weak team members have great negative impact
    - 'done' not easy to define and can cause cost/time overruns
