- When you have more info/data, predictability decreases
- Keep in mind the relation b/w supplier and demand
- Bearish Harami
  - Big green candle then next day small red candle
  - Buyers are **exhausted**
  - Price will decrease
- Bullish Harami
  - Big red candle then next day small green candle

18. Trends, Support & Resistance  
- Principle of technical analysis: prices move along trend, and history repeats
- Trends
  - Uptrend
  - Downtrend
  - Sidetrend
  - Channels
    - 2 trendline as envelopes (upper trendline and lower trendline)
  - Trendlines
  - Trend Lengths
![trend](./ch18_trend.png)
- Support: Corresponds to lower trendline
- Resistance: Corresponds to upper trendline
- Buy at support and sell at resistance
  - Everyone does buying at support and selling at resistance - keeping persistent
- Retailers put limits as round numbers ($5.00, not $4.97)
- Sell/buy is done within resistance/support 
- When trend breaks, support may switch to resistance

19. Chart Patterns
- Head and shoulders
- Double top, multiple top
  - Implies resistance
- Double bottom, multiple bottom
  - Implies support
- Triangles
  - Ascending Triangle: trendline going upper while there is resistance. Buyers getting more aggressive while sellers remain strong
  - Descending Triangle: trendline going lower while there is support. Buyers are consistent while sellers become more willing to sell
  - Regular Triagnle: one trendline going lower while another trendline going upper. Buyers and sellers become less patient
- Cup and handle
  - U or V shape then scattering
- Rounding bottom  
  - Flat U shape

20. Volume
- In technical analysis, price and volume
- You need to see the volume curves as well

21. Bollinger Bands
- An indicator based on volume and price
- Plots possible max/min price over time
- Number of days to use = 20 as default
- Standard deviation = 2 as default
- Bands become narrow when stationary
- Bands expand when price moves alot

22. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Can be used to predict how price moves
- From 0 to 100
- RSI = 100 - 100/ (1+RS)
  - RS = Average gain/ Average loss in previous days (14 as default)
  - 70-100: overbought (green candles are way higher than red candles)
  - 0-30: oversold (red candles are way bigger than green candles)
  - 30-70 are ordinary
  - When overbought, don't sell yet. When it goes below 70, it is time to sell
  - When oversold, don't buy yet. When it goes above 30, it is time to buy

23. Average True Range (ATR)
- ATR = sum of absolute value of increase/decrease then divide by days
  - Shows an average of increase/decrease

24. Expectancy
- E = \sum x_i p_i
  - x_i: value
  - p_i: value
- Ex:
  - An envelope of $1 with 100% probability
  - An envelope of $10 with 10% probability: this is more volatile

25. Gambling vs Educated Betting  
- Gampling: play games of chance for money. The act of gambling money on the outcome of an unpredictable event
- Educated Betting: The act of gambling money on the outcome of an event that you perceive a positive exptected value

27. Batting Average & Win/Loss Ratio
- Batting Average: the average probability that a trader is right. The number of profitable trades divided by the total number of trades during a specific period
- Win/Loss Ratio: the ratio of the average profitable tades over the averag unprofitable trades

28. Risk Management
- Systematic risk: the risk inherent to the entire market or market segment. Aka undiversifiable risk/volatility/market risk.
- Unsystematic risk: company or industry specific hazard that is inherent in each investment. Aka nonsystematic risk/specific risk/diversifiable risk/residual risk. This can be reduced through diversification
- Risk management
  - Risk Acceptance
  - Risk Avoidance
  - Risk Limitation
    - Stop Losses: Limit stop price and sell when triggered
  - Risk Transference

29. Money Management
- Maximum risk per position must never exceed 5%
- 2% is ideal (in a single trade)
- Importance of taking losses

30. Position Sizing
- How many shares to buy and how to buy them
- Different methods
- Simple position size = (Max loss per trade)/(amount you can lose per share)
- Ex:
  - 100k fund
  - 2% loss limit (per trade) = $2000
  - Assume purchase price = 4.17, stop loss price = 3.25
    - 2% loss per trade, assuming max 10 sequential trading = 2*10 = 20%
    - Max loss per share = $0.92
  - Stop loss price = 3.25
  - Position sizing = 2000/0.92 = 2170 share

31. The importance of Psychology

32. Loss Aversion
- Losses have a bigger negative impact than equivalent gains 
  - 2x more negative

33. Endowment Effect
- We place more value on somehting that we own than we didn't own it
- Correlated with loss aversion
- This is why it is hard to be objective on shares which we own

34. Status Quo Bias
- We prefer staying in our current situation/state than changing situation/state
- Correlated with loss aversion
- Timeline requirement may remove this bias

35. Anchoring Effect
- We anchor to the first decision/information when making subsequent decision

36. Confirmation Bias
- We search for information that confirms our beliefs

37. Genes and Instincts

38. Misconceptions and Ways to Improve

  - Industry or world trends
    - Ex: health care and aging population
  - Sources
    - News
    - Management statements
    - Research analysts
  - Understand the company & industry

53. Key Financial Ratios When Buying Stocks
- Where do ratios come from?
  - Balance sheet
  - Income statement
  - Cash flow statement
- Important to compare within industry
- Some ratios are more important to some industries than others
  - Ex: inventory turn
- Some ratios more important to stock type than others
  - Ex: Dividend yield
- Hundreds of ratios. Focused on key ones (paralysis by analysis)

54. Update: Now More Ratios!

55. Stock Ratio Categories
- Valuation (price)
- Profitability
- Liquidity
- Dept (Solvency)
- Efficiency (Operating)

56. Valuation Ratios Intro: Is the stock at a good price relative to some measure
- Valuation ratios try to answer one question
  - Fair price?
  - Really good (bargain - buy!)
  - Overpriced (stay away)
- Higher stock price does not mean it's a better stock to buy today
- Good to compare companies against competitors
- Some ratios may work better than others for certain companies
  - Ex: P/E ratio no good for companies who have no earnings (losing money)

57. Valuation: Price Earning (P/E)
- What you need: Income statement, most recent stock price
- P/E ratio = Price per share /  Earnings Per share
- Low P/E ratio means that it is under-valued stock (?)
  - Definition of low varies from industry to industry

58. Valuation: Price To Earnings Growth (PEG)
- From Income statement, recent stock price
- PEG ratio = PE ratio / projected annual growth in earnings per share
- A very general rule of thumb is that any PEG ratio below 1.0 is considered to be a good value
- A good tool to find under-valued stocks

59. Valuation: Price To Sales (P/S)
- Stock price divided by sales per share
- Can be applied to companies that do not have recent positive earnings (they have losses), having momentary downtrend or new/emerging companies who are not profitable yet. Early start-up?
- Range of 1.0-2.0: good p/s ratio
- Less than 1.0 is excellent

60. Valuation: Price to Book (P/B)
- Ratio of price to book value per share
- Book value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account - in other words, company's value if it liquidates its assets and paid back all its liabilties
- Can be used to find under-valued stocks
- Pros
  - Stable metric: given the relative stability of the base metric (book value), this ratio doesn't fluctuate as much as others like P/E
- Cons
  - Accounting differences can make it hard to compare. Hard to compare companies due to differences in industry - different classification on their balance sheet
- Range of 1.0-3.0: good P/B ratio
- Less than 1.0 is excellent

61. Valuation: EV/Revenue (Enterprise Value to Revenue)
- Eneterprise value/Revenue
  - Enterprise value = market capitalization + debt - cash and cash equivalents
  - Revenue = Total Annual Revenue
- For early-stage or high-growth business that do not have positive earnings
- Alternative to P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA
- Advantage
  - Beneficial when there are significant differences b/w accounting polices
  - Tech startup who has negative free cash flows
  - Easy to find revenue data for most business
- Disadvantage
  - Does not take into account, the cost structure of the company
  - Ignores profitability and generation of cash flow
  - Hard to compare across different industries and different company phases (early vs mature)
- Range of 1.0-3.0: good EV/Revenue ratio
  - Lower is better (undevalued)

62. Valuation: EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA)
- Enterprise multiple = EV/EBITDA
  - EV = Enterprise value = market capitalization +  total debt - cash and cash equivalents
  - EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
- Good EV/EBITDA ratio: less than 10.0
- Lower is better (undervalued)

63. Case Study: Comparing Two Stocks Valuation Ratios
- Hormel vs Beyond meet
- 
64. Price to Cash Flow Ratio (May Need to Calculate Unlike Other Ratios)
- The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio measures how much cash a company is generating relative to its market value
- P/CF is a good alternative to P/E as cash flows are less susceptible to manipulation than earnings
