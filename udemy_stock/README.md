- When you have more info/data, predictability decreases
- Keep in mind the relation b/w supplier and demand
- Bearish Harami
  - Big green candle then next day small red candle
  - Buyers are **exhausted**
  - Price will decrease
- Bullish Harami
  - Big red candle then next day small green candle

18. Trends, Support & Resistance  
- Principle of technical analysis: prices move along trend, and history repeats
- Trends
  - Uptrend
  - Downtrend
  - Sidetrend
  - Channels
    - 2 trendline as envelopes (upper trendline and lower trendline)
  - Trendlines
  - Trend Lengths
![trend](./ch18_trend.png)
- Support: Corresponds to lower trendline
- Resistance: Corresponds to upper trendline
- Buy at support and sell at resistance
  - Everyone does buying at support and selling at resistance - keeping persistent
- Retailers put limits as round numbers ($5.00, not $4.97)
- Sell/buy is done within resistance/support 
- When trend breaks, support may switch to resistance

19. Chart Patterns
- Head and shoulders
- Double top, multiple top
  - Implies resistance
- Double bottom, multiple bottom
  - Implies support
- Triangles
  - Ascending Triangle: trendline going upper while there is resistance. Buyers getting more aggressive while sellers remain strong
  - Descending Triangle: trendline going lower while there is support. Buyers are consistent while sellers become more willing to sell
  - Regular Triagnle: one trendline going lower while another trendline going upper. Buyers and sellers become less patient
- Cup and handle
  - U or V shape then scattering
- Rounding bottom  
  - Flat U shape

20. Volume
- In technical analysis, price and volume
- You need to see the volume curves as well

21. Bollinger Bands
- An indicator based on volume and price
- Plots possible max/min price over time
- Number of days to use = 20 as default
- Standard deviation = 2 as default
- Bands become narrow when stationary
- Bands expand when price moves alot

22. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Can be used to predict how price moves
- From 0 to 100
- RSI = 100 - 100/ (1+RS)
  - RS = Average gain/ Average loss in previous days (14 as default)
  - 70-100: overbought (green candles are way higher than red candles)
  - 0-30: oversold (red candles are way bigger than green candles)
  - 30-70 are ordinary
  - When overbought, don't sell yet. When it goes below 70, it is time to sell
  - When oversold, don't buy yet. When it goes above 30, it is time to buy

23. Average True Range (ATR)
- ATR = sum of absolute value of increase/decrease then divide by days
  - Shows an average of increase/decrease

24. Expectancy
- E = \sum x_i p_i
  - x_i: value
  - p_i: value
- Ex:
  - An envelope of $1 with 100% probability
  - An envelope of $10 with 10% probability: this is more volatile

25. Gambling vs Educated Betting  
- Gampling: play games of chance for money. The act of gambling money on the outcome of an unpredictable event
- Educated Betting: The act of gambling money on the outcome of an event that you perceive a positive exptected value

27. Batting Average & Win/Loss Ratio
- Batting Average: the average probability that a trader is right. The number of profitable trades divided by the total number of trades during a specific period
- Win/Loss Ratio: the ratio of the average profitable tades over the averag unprofitable trades

28. Risk Management
- Systematic risk: the risk inherent to the entire market or market segment. Aka undiversifiable risk/volatility/market risk.
- Unsystematic risk: company or industry specific hazard that is inherent in each investment. Aka nonsystematic risk/specific risk/diversifiable risk/residual risk. This can be reduced through diversification
- Risk management
  - Risk Acceptance
  - Risk Avoidance
  - Risk Limitation
    - Stop Losses: Limit stop price and sell when triggered
  - Risk Transference

29. Money Management
- Maximum risk per position must never exceed 5%
- 2% is ideal (in a single trade)
- Importance of taking losses

30. Position Sizing
- How many shares to buy and how to buy them
- Different methods
- Simple position size = (Max loss per trade)/(amount you can lose per share)
- Ex:
  - 100k fund
  - 2% loss limit (per trade) = $2000
  - Assume purchase price = 4.17, stop loss price = 3.25
    - 2% loss per trade, assuming max 10 sequential trading = 2*10 = 20%
    - Max loss per share = $0.92
  - Stop loss price = 3.25
  - Position sizing = 2000/0.92 = 2170 share

31. The importance of Psychology

32. Loss Aversion
- Losses have a bigger negative impact than equivalent gains 
  - 2x more negative

33. Endowment Effect
- We place more value on somehting that we own than we didn't own it
- Correlated with loss aversion
- This is why it is hard to be objective on shares which we own

34. Status Quo Bias
- We prefer staying in our current situation/state than changing situation/state
- Correlated with loss aversion
- Timeline requirement may remove this bias

35. Anchoring Effect
- We anchor to the first decision/information when making subsequent decision

36. Confirmation Bias
- We search for information that confirms our beliefs

37. Genes and Instincts

38. Misconceptions and Ways to Improve

  - Industry or world trends
    - Ex: health care and aging population
  - Sources
    - News
    - Management statements
    - Research analysts
  - Understand the company & industry

53. Key Financial Ratios When Buying Stocks
- Where do ratios come from?
  - Balance sheet
  - Income statement
  - Cash flow statement
- Important to compare within industry
- Some ratios are more important to some industries than others
  - Ex: inventory turn
- Some ratios more important to stock type than others
  - Ex: Dividend yield
- Hundreds of ratios. Focused on key ones (paralysis by analysis)

54. Update: Now More Ratios!

55. Stock Ratio Categories
- Valuation (price)
- Profitability
- Liquidity
- Dept (Solvency)
- Efficiency (Operating)

56. Valuation Ratios Intro: Is the stock at a good price relative to some measure
- Valuation ratios try to answer one question
  - Fair price?
  - Really good (bargain - buy!)
  - Overpriced (stay away)
- Higher stock price does not mean it's a better stock to buy today
- Good to compare companies against competitors
- Some ratios may work better than others for certain companies
  - Ex: P/E ratio no good for companies who have no earnings (losing money)

57. Valuation: Price Earning (P/E)
- What you need: Income statement, most recent stock price
- P/E ratio = Price per share /  Earnings Per share
- Low P/E ratio means that it is under-valued stock (?)
  - Definition of low varies from industry to industry

58. Valuation: Price To Earnings Growth (PEG)
- From Income statement, recent stock price
- PEG ratio = PE ratio / projected annual growth in earnings per share
- A very general rule of thumb is that any PEG ratio below 1.0 is considered to be a good value
- A good tool to find under-valued stocks

59. Valuation: Price To Sales (P/S)
- Stock price divided by sales per share
- Can be applied to companies that do not have recent positive earnings (they have losses), having momentary downtrend or new/emerging companies who are not profitable yet. Early start-up?
- Range of 1.0-2.0: good p/s ratio
- Less than 1.0 is excellent

60. Valuation: Price to Book (P/B)
- Ratio of price to book value per share
- Book value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account - in other words, company's value if it liquidates its assets and paid back all its liabilties
- Can be used to find under-valued stocks
- Pros
  - Stable metric: given the relative stability of the base metric (book value), this ratio doesn't fluctuate as much as others like P/E
- Cons
  - Accounting differences can make it hard to compare. Hard to compare companies due to differences in industry - different classification on their balance sheet
- Range of 1.0-3.0: good P/B ratio
- Less than 1.0 is excellent

61. Valuation: EV/Revenue (Enterprise Value to Revenue)
- Eneterprise value/Revenue
  - Enterprise value = market capitalization + debt - cash and cash equivalents
  - Revenue = Total Annual Revenue
- For early-stage or high-growth business that do not have positive earnings
- Alternative to P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA
- Advantage
  - Beneficial when there are significant differences b/w accounting polices
  - Tech startup who has negative free cash flows
  - Easy to find revenue data for most business
- Disadvantage
  - Does not take into account, the cost structure of the company
  - Ignores profitability and generation of cash flow
  - Hard to compare across different industries and different company phases (early vs mature)
- Range of 1.0-3.0: good EV/Revenue ratio
  - Lower is better (undevalued)

62. Valuation: EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value to EBITDA)
- Enterprise multiple = EV/EBITDA
  - EV = Enterprise value = market capitalization +  total debt - cash and cash equivalents
  - EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
- Good EV/EBITDA ratio: less than 10.0
- Lower is better (undervalued)

63. Case Study: Comparing Two Stocks Valuation Ratios
- Hormel vs Beyond meet
- 
64. Price to Cash Flow Ratio (May Need to Calculate Unlike Other Ratios)
- The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio measures how much cash a company is generating relative to its market value
- P/CF is a good alternative to P/E as cash flows are less susceptible to manipulation than earnings
  - Cash flow does not incorporate non-cash expense items like deprecation or amortization (income statement metrics)
- Price to Cash flow ratio = Share price / operating cash flow per share
- In order to avoid volatility in the multiple, 30-60 day average price can be used
- Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF)
  - More rigorous than P/CF
  - Uses free cash flow (ECF), which subtracts capital expenditures (CapEx) from a company's total OCF
- Good P/CF: 
  - Generally 10 or less
  - Lower Better
- Good P/FCF
  - Generally 15 or less
  - Lower Better

65. Valuation Ratio Wrap up
- Is the price I am paying for a stock good price?
  - Fair price?
  - Really good (Bargain)
  - Overpriced (Stay away)

66. Dividend Ratios: Dividend Yield
- Dividend yield = dividend per share/price per share

67. Dividend Ratios: Dividend Payout
- Dividend payout ratio
  - What you need: income statement
  - Dividend payout ratio = dividend/net income
- Lower the ratio the better
  - Too high ratio might not be sustainable
- Less than 50% excellent
- 50-60% good
- 60-70% ok
- Cautious as get higher
- Compare in industry
  - Utilities normally have higher payout ratios
  - REIT required to have higher payout

68. Profitability: Return of Assets (ROA)
- What you need: income statement, balance sheet
- ROA = Net income / average total assets
  - Higher, better
  - How good the company is at using its assets to make money

69. Profitability: Return on Equity (ROE)
- What you need: income statement, balance sheet
- ROE = Net income/average stockholder equity
  - Implies how good a company is at rewarding its shareholders for their investment

70. Profitability: Profit Margin
- What you need: income statement
- Profit margin = net income / sales
  - Implies how much of a company's total sales flow though to the bottom line
  - Higher profits are better for shareholders, as is a high profit margin

71. Liquidity: Current And Quick Ratio
- Can a company cover their short-term debts (bills)?
- What if they cannot cover their debts?
  - Reduce expenses
    - Layoff
    - Spend less on training, marketing, and R&D
  - Sell off assets
    - Plants, factories, divisions, ...
  - Take on more debt (longer term to cover short term)
  - Cut or eliminate their dividend
  - Possible results
    - Stock price goes down
    - Bankruptcy
- Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
  - Current assets: cash, accounts receivable, inventory and other assets that are expectec turned into cash in LESS THAN ONE YEAR
  - Current liabilities: accounts payable, wages, taxes payable, and the current portion of long-term debt
  - Keys:
    - Higher Better
    - Best to compare against peers
  - Quick Ratio
    - QR = (CE + MS + AR) / CL
    - CE = Cash & Equivalents
    - MS = Market securities
    - AR = Accounts receivable
    - CL = Current Liabilities
    - Keys
      - More conservative that the Current Ratio
      - Looks at assets that are more liquid and can be easily be turned into cash
      - Higher Better
      - Best to compare against peers

72. Debt: Debt to Equity
- Debt to Equity Ratio
  - You need: balance sheet
  - Debt to equity ratio = Total liabilities / Total shareholder equity
  - Implies: when this ratio increases, it becomes more risky because if it becomes unable to meet its debt obligations, it will be forced into bankruptcy

73. Debt: Interest Coverage
- What you need: income statement
- Interest coverage ratio (times interest earned, TIE) = EBIT / Interest Expense
  - Implies: Both EBIT (operating income) and interest expense are found on income statement. TIE is a measure of how well a company can meet its interest payment obligations. 
  - Anything lower that 1.0 is usually a sign of trouble

74. Efficiency: Asset Turnover
- What you need: income statement, balance sheet
- Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Average Total Assets
  - Implies: like ROA, this tells you how good the company is at using its assets to make products to sell
  - Higher Better

75. Efficiency: Inventory Turnover
- What you need: Income statement, balance sheet
- Inventory turnover ratio = costs of goods sold /average inventory
  - Implies: efficiency in cycling inventory
  - How fast the company has to replenish its shelves
  - High inventory turnover ratio indicates that the firm is selling inventory relatively quickly

76. Analyzing Ratio Demo With Real Companies
- Coke vs Pepsi

## Section 8: Picking Stocks: Technical Analysis (Charting) Using Charts, Patterns, and Trends

77. Understanding Technical Analysis and Fundamental Investing
- Two primary ways
  - Fundamentals
    - Understand the Business model
    - Differentiation
    - Features & Benefits
    - Is there a first mover advantage
    - Barriers to entry or copying from others
    - Are they in it for the long-term?
    - Ratios (P/E, dividend yield)
    - Measure business
      - Current/past performance
      - Predict future?
    - Ratios are not technical analysis
  - Technical Analysis

78. Technical Analysis Introduction and Big idea
- What is technical analysis
  - Aka - charting
  - Can be used in stock/bitcoin/crypto/forex
  - Looking for repeatable patterns
  - Fundamentals don't matter
  - Herd mentality
    - Traveling together but breakout may happen

79. Technical Analysis Core Concepts
- Repeatable behavior under repeatable circumstances
  - Predictability
  - Not guesswork - strategy
- The trend is your friend
  - Identify trend after breakout
  - Get in and out (trading)
- Not 100% accurate
- Predictors 
  - No technique works all the time
  - No technique works on every stock
- Unpredictable events

80. Technical Analysis and Unpredictable Events Example
- Brexit

81. How I learned about Brexit: An investing story

82. Line Charts (Technical Analysis)

83. Candlestick Charts
- Green/white: closing price higher than open
- Red/Black: closing price lower than open
- Open/close price depends on color: Top/Bottom of Box
- Long line = price range (low-high)

84. Drawing Trend Lines and Caannels
- Trend is your friend
- Pick a point to start at then
  - Down trend - Connect highs
  - Uptrend - Connect lows
- Channels: b/w upper trend line and lower trend line

85. Moving Average: Simple and Weighted (Technical Analysis)
- Price above line: strength
- Price below line = weakness
- Watch for crossover points

86. Chart Patterns: Rectangles (Support & Resistance Lines)
- Trading range bounded by 
  - Support line (bottom)
  - Resistance line (top)
- Until there is a breakout of the rectangle
- After breakout usually moves in direction on previous trend but not always
![rectangle](./ch86_rectangle.png)

87. Chart Patterns: Triangles (Technical Analysis)
- Converging support and resistance levels
  - Either rising or declining prices
- Trading price range narrows
- Breakout usually occurs in direction of the original trend
![ascending](./ch87_ascending.png)
![descending](./ch87_descending.png)

88. Chart Patterns: Flags (Technical Analysis)
- Similar to triangle
- Sharp rise or fall
- Lots of trading volume at the flag pole

89. Chart Pattern: Head and Shoulders (Technical Analysis)
- See support/resistance breaks
- See trend
![headshoulder](./ch89_head_shoulder.png)
![inverse](./ch89_inverse.png)

90. Chart Pattern: Cup With Handle
- Combines price pattern and volume leveles and moving averages
![cuphandle](./ch90_cup.png)

91. Technical Analysis Final Thoughts
- Another tool in your toolbox
- Ok to use with fundamentals
- Use what you are comfortable with
- Certainly not foolproof
- Over analysis may lead to paralysis (do nothing)
- Too much analysis may assign meaning where there is none - Michael Kahn
- **The Trend is your friend. Wait for it to develop**

## Section 9: Risk and Risk Measures in the Stock Market

93. Introduction to Measuring Risk
- Increase risk = increase reward
- Decrease risk = decreased reward
- Can we measure risk?
  - One stock is riskier than another?
  - More than a gut feel or rule of thumb
  - Yes we can measure
- Volatility
  - The degree to which a stock's price moves
  - A stock with a price that fluctuates wildly - wide range of highs and lows or moves erratically - is considered highly volatile
  - A stock that maintains a relatively stawble price has low volatility

94. Pair Stock Risk with your own personal view of risk
- Can statistically measure stock risks but also consider how RISKY do you want to be?
  - Want less volatility, less chance for losses, SAFER investments but less reward as in profits... or more risk and greater potential for reward
  - Can choose stocks that match those criteria with a variety of risk measurement tools
  - Note: each tool does something a little different

95. Sharpe Ratio
- Sharpe ratio adjusts a portfolio's past performance - or expected future performance - for the excess risk that was taken by the investor
- Removing the rate of return on a risk free investment, such as a US treasury bond or T-Bill, from the experienced rate of return
- Think, I can make X with a risk-free investment, and I getting the extra return by taking on more risk and by how much
- A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 is generally considered good because you are getting excess returns relative to its volatility. Also wise to consider the peers in its class
  - Sharpe Ratio =  (Return of portfolio - risk-free rate)/standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return
- Example
  - Mutual fund returned 15% last year
  - Current risk free rate (Treasury Bond Yield) is 3.5%
  - Standard Deviation(volatility measure) 12%
  - Sharpe ratio = (15-3.5)/12 = 95.8%
    - Less than 1.0 and not a great Sharpe Ratio
    - More risk relative to returns
- Sortino Ratio
  - Variation of Sharpe Ratio
  - Considers downside only
  - (Return of portfolio - risk-free rate)/standard deviation of the downside
- Treynor Ratio
  - Measures how successful an investment is in providing compensation to investors for taking on investment risk
  - Reliant on a portfolio's beta - sensitivity of the portfolio's returns to movements in the market
  - (Return of portfolio - risk-free rate)/beta of the portfolio
- Big idea
  - How much excess return am I getting on a portfolio or basket of holdings, for the amount of risk I am taking on
  - How much above a RISK-FREE rate can I get?

96. Beta
- Measures the amount of risk (volatility) an individual security, mutual fund, or ETF has relative to a broader index
- The broader market is assigned a beta of 1.0
- Evaluate based on relation to that 1.0 market rate
- How to evaluate beta
  - B/w 0 and 1.0: less volatile than the market. Cash would have beta of 0
  - Equals 1.0: Overall market. If a stock as a beta of 1.0, it will move in the same direction as the index, by the same amount
  - Greater than 1.0: Volatility is greater than the broader index
  - Negative beta: Rare. Moves opposite direction of the index
- Example
  - A stock of beta 2.0
    - Two times as volatile as the overall market
    - If the market overall goes up 10%, this stock could rise by 205
    - If the market declines 6%, can expect a loss of 12%
  - A stock of beta 0.5
    - 10% market up would mean 5% gain
    - 10% down would loss of 5% only
- Formula: beta = covariance/variance
  - No need to calculate. Look up online    

97. Alpha
- Goes hand in hand with beta
- More of a performance measure
- Alpha refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark or index return
- Active mutual fund managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios
- Represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund's return, beyond what you could get with a passive index fund
- Evaluating Alpha
  - Positive number means outperformed the broader index
    - Fund A return is 15% and index return is 10% then Alpha is 5%
  - Negative number means underperformed the broader index
    - Fund A return is 4% while index return is 10% then Alpha is -6%
- Big idea
  - More of a performance measure that is commonly placed with risk or volatility measures
  - Use Beta for the volatility measure
  - You may have high Alpha but Beta volatility is TOO high. Skip such cases

98. R-Squared
- A statistical measure that represents the percentage of a mutual fund portfolio or a security's movements that can be explained by or attributed to movements in a benchmark index
- Ranges from 0 to 100
- In general
  - B/w 85-100 has a performance record that is closely correlated to the index
  - 70 or less means typically does not perform like the index
- Example
  - S&P 500 index fund would have an R-squared of 100
  - A fund of 95: performs almost exactly like the benchmark
  - A fund of 40: not due as much to general results of the index
- Why this is important?
  - If fund A has high fees but it is tracking the benchmark index, avoid this
- R^2 = 1 - unexplained variation/total variation
  - No need to calculate. Look up online

99. Standard Deviation
- Statistically, standard deviation measures the dispersion of data from its expected value
- For stocks, mutual funds, and ETF, it indicates how much the current return is deviating from its expected historical normal returns
- Higher the standard deviation, the greater the possible outcomes, high and low, thus more volatility

100. Broader Risk Categories: Systemic and un-systemic risk
- Risk Categories
  - Systemic Risk
    - Associated with the broader market
    - War, covid19
  - Unsystemic risk
    - Associatd with a particular, company, industry or sector
    - Oil stock due to OPEC

101. Screencast: Looking up stock risk
- Primary is Beta
- Hard to find other measures
  - Behind pay walls
  - May find in a company's investors resources section of website
  - Can manually calculate
- Use investing.com/yahoo.com/finviz.com to look up Beta  

102. Screencast: Looking up mutual fund and ETF risk measures
- Example 1 (Different categories)

125. The spread: When investing & Trading stocks
- A stock quote is the price of the last trade b/w a buyer and seller
- The term **bid** refers to the highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of a stock at any given time
- The term **ask** refers to the lowest price at which a seller will sell the stock
- The bid price will almost always be lower than the ask or offer price. The difference b/w the bid price and the ask price is called **spread**
- The spreads is the transcation cost
- When a trade is made: traders buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price the market maker buys at the bid price and sells at the ask price
- More liquid, less spread

126. Introduction to Order Types

127. Market and Limit Orders
- Market order
  - The simplest and most common
  - You are willing to take whatever price is presented to you when your order is executed
  - Can be a little higher or lower than expected
- Limit order
  - Allows you to limit either the maximum price you will pay or the minimum price you are willing to accept when buying or selling a security

128. All-or-None. Fill or Kill, Immediate Or Cancel, and Good Till Canceled Orders
- An order may take time to be completed and you might end up paying different prices for different parts of the order
- All-or-none (AON) order requires the security to be purchased in a single transaction or not at all
  - Your order may not be executed
- Fill-or-kill (FOK) order must be filled immediately in its entirety or it is killed (canceled)
  - Never partially executed
- Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) allows partial amounts of the order to be completed
- Good-till-canceled (GTC) ramins open until one of three things occurs
  - It is completely filled
  - You cancel the order
  - A certain time period set by your online broker
- Risks with GTC
  - You may forget the order
  - If you place large trade with GTC, you may pay a commision each day your oder is partially filled. You might be billed with multiple transactions

129. Short Sell and Buy to Cover Orders
- Shorting (공매도) enables you to profit if you can correctly predict that the price of a security **you don't own** will fall
- Buy to Cover Order
- In order to sell short, you must have Margin Privileges in your brokerage account. That means you can trade with more money than you have in your accout if you wish. 
- You must maintain enough purchasing power in your account to carry out a buy to cover order on your short sale
- If the price of your shorted stock actually increases, doing the opposite of what you thought, and you don't have enough money in your account to buy the shares back at the higher price (take a loss), **you will face a margin call**, a demand by your broker to put more cash or securities in your account to be able to cover the trade

130. Stop Loss, Limit, and Training Order Types
- Stop-Loss
  - A stop order automatically converts into a market order when a predetermined price - the stop price - is reached
  - At that point, the ordinary rules of market orders apply: the order is guaranteed to be executed, but you won't know the exact price
- Stop-limit
  - In constrast, a stop limit order automatically converts into a limit order when the stop price is reached
  - Minimum price you are williing to accept when selling a security
  - As with other limit orders, your stop limit order may or may not be executed depending on the price movement of the security
- Trailing Stop Order
  - You set a stop price as either a fixed amount or a percentage of the current market price
  - If the security's price does what you hope it would do, your order will sit there (unexecuted) and automatically adjust upwards as the price increases

131. Bracketed Orders
- Setting a profit target and downside loss protection a the same time in one order

132. Note on Fractional Shares

133. Fractional Shares Allow You to Invest with Less Money

| Pros | Cons|
|------|-----|
| Access to more stocks of high price  | Can encourage active trading. More fees?|
| Very low-cost diversification             | Limited selection of assets (Stocks, ETF, crypto)|
| Less money in cash... more fully invested | Reduced liquidity...fractional shares trade slower than full shares|
| Works well for automated investing        | Not every broker offers fractional shares |

134. Final Thoughts on Order Types

## Section 14: IPO Going Public: How a company sells stock publicly for the first time

135. Introduction to the Going Public Section
- Many ways to go public
  - Take a private company and have it listed on a stock exchange
  - Able to sell shares to the public
- Most well known and used is IPO
  - Initial Public Offering
- Why would a private company want to go public
  - Downside of going public is more reporting and regulatory requirements
    - Just to go public and also in future operations
    - Can be very time consuming and costly
  - The ANSWER = MONEY
    - Raise lots of money by selling shares to the public for the first time
    - More exposure (talk in the press)
    - Founders and venture capitalists cash in

136. IPO: Initial Public Offering
- Big institutional investors get IPO price
- When hits market that's when we can buy
- Can be extremely volatile early as price settles
- At **90** day mark insiders can sell
  - Many sell to cash out putting downward pricing pressure
- Don't buy an IPO just because it is an IPO

137. IPO Case Study (Facebook at IPO Now Meta)
- 47% down at 68th day since IPO

138. Direct Listing Placement (DLP)
- Direct Placement or Direct Public Offerings (DPO)
- Selling existing shares instead of offering new ones
  - Not raising new money
- Without getting help from intermediaries like investment banks
  - Faster and less costly than an IPO
- Direct listings are better for companies that have solid brand recognition, but don't need urgent money

139. Article: SPAC Popularity & Availability

140. What is a SPAC?
- Like an IPO but different
- Aka Reverse IPO
- Aka blank check company
- Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)
  - No operations
    - Don't make anything
    - Do not provide a service
  - Does have money (cash)
    - Investor's money
  - Sole purpose: to raise money in an IPO to buy another company
- Upon formation of a SPAC
  - Publicly traded on an exchange
  - Still just an idea at first ... no named target when first listed
  - Price to buy in will now go up or down like a stock
- SPACs will typically grant management an 18-24 month period in which to either:
  - Complete an acquisition
  - Return money to shareholders
- You can get your money back if you
  - do not like the acquisition
    - Redeem from trust prior to the merger IPO completion (typically for $10)
- After merger, the SPAC is dissolved
  - and becomes the new IPO company and traded under that companies stock symbol
- Can lose money
  - Two years until target company found (opportunity cost)
  - SPAC could trade below what you paid for it
  - Hold and get new merged company and that stock tumbles before you sell it

141. Why is SPAC Known as a Blank Check Company?
- No operations
- Don't make anything
- Sole purpose: to raise money in an IPO to buy another company
- Investors
  - Give money to SPAC management
  - Trust them to make a good purchase
  - Sort of a blank check
  - Gives Us a ROI (Return on Investment) in return
- Summary
  - Writing a blank check to management
  - Here is the money ... you decide what is best

142. How are SPAC's Created

## Section 15: Investing In International Stocks

143. International Investing Importance

144. Invest on your country's exchange with depository receipts

  - Foreign company lists it shares on a local stock exchange
  - ADR = American Depository Receipts
  - European Depository Receipts (EDRs)
  - Luxembourg Depository Receipts (LDRs)
  - Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs)
  - Easy to buy and sell ... just like a domestic stock

145. Global Depository Receipts
- Similar yet different than depository receipts
- Depository receipts available only in that country
- GDR is available in multiple countries

146. Invest On Other Stock Exchange With FDI: Foreign Direct Investment
- Buying stocks directly through the foreign country
  - Open a global account with a broker in your home country: Fidelity, Charles Schwab, ...
  - Open an account with a local broker in the target country: MONEX BOOM

147. Using Mutual Funds & ETF to Invest in Foreign Stocks
- Great way for international investing
- Easy ... Buy a basket of stocks
- Instant diversification
- Key is to look beyond the name ... look at the holdings

148. Demonstration: International Mutual Funds and ETF Evaluation
- Janus Henderson: Asia Equity Fund (JAQIA)
  - Excluding Japan
  - Samsung, TSMC, Tencent, ...

149. Your Plan for Investing Internationally and what to consider
- Ask yourself
  - What countries ... and why
  - Developed and/or emerging markets
  - How
