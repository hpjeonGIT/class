- Commerical Off-the-Shelf (COTS): anti-virus program, word processors, ...
- Programmers/developers
  - Application development
  - app-dev team will have a manager under CIO

### 11. Foundation - meet the IT operations team

### 12. Foundation - meet the IT security team

## Section 2: FISMA compliance - RMF Steps 1-3

### 13. FISMA - introduction to FISMA compliance
- Security compliance
  - The inspector checklist
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
  - Enacted in 2002
  - Addresses security control requirements
- How does a network becomes FISMA compliant?
  - National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST)
- FISMA guideline
  - Part 1: Creating a system security plan (SSP)
    - Ex: Min password policy
  - Part 2: Security Assessment
    - Authority to Operate (ATO) is given when approved

### 14. Intro to NIST 800-37
- All applications are available in NIST web site

### 15. FISMA - RMF Step 1 - Security categorization
- ATO: every enterprise network holding federal date needs to have
- NIST requirements
  - Special Publications (SP)
  - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
- Do google search SP 800-53  
  - https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final
- Risk Management Framework
  - Step 1: Categorize Information Systems
    - Low/moderate/High
    - 3 Objectives: CIA
      - Confidentiality
      - Integrity: someone may corrupt data 
      - Availability
  - Step 2: Select Security controls
  - Step 3: Implement Security controls
  - Step 4: Assessment Security Controls
  - Step 5: Authorize Information Systems
  - Step 6: Monitor Security Controls

### 16. FISMA - Security categorization part 2
- Information types and information systems
  - Information system is the HW/SW that contains the information type
- FIPS 199 guides you on system categorizations
- Identify the level of CIA 
  - Interview the business manager that oversee the day to day handling of the information type
- Overall security categorization is selected from the highest impact level from the information types

### 17. RMF Step 0 - Task P1-P3
- RMF step 0 activities
  - Task P1: Roles and responsibilities
    - Appendix D of NIST 800-37
  - Task P2: Establish risk management strategy
    - Threats surrounding the organization
    - How security and privacy risks are handled
    - How much risk is ok for organization leadership
    - What are ways organization assess and respond to risk
    - Process in place to check risk consistently
    - HW/SW supply chain    
  - Task P3: Conduct organization level risk assessment
    - Result of ATO (Risk assessment report)
    - External systems that connects to your network
    - Supply chain
    - Risks associated with access to your systems (internal/external)
    - Risk associated with location

### 18. RMF Step 0 - Mappings
- List of remaining step 0 tasks
  - Task P4: publishing organizationally tailored control base line
    - Helps to prepare for RMF step 2 - selecting security controls
  - Task P5: identifying common control
    - Helps to prepare for RMF step 2 - selecting security controls
  - Task P6: prioritizing systems with the same impact level
    - Can be completed after RMF-step 1 is completed
  - Task P7: Defining a continuous monitoring strategy
    - Helps to prepare for RMF step - 6
  - Task P8-18: system level preparation tasks
    - Gathering details about the system itself

### 19. FISMA - RMF Step 1 - Security categorization part 3
- System owner is responsible for procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and retirement of an information system
  - Ex: CIO, directors/branch chiefs
  - Required documents to decide the level of security: Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) and the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
    - Template: from USAID website
    - Or create from scratch

### 20. RMF Step 0 - How to prioritize systems with the same impact level (task P)
- When two systems have the same impact level categorization  
  - High-moderate, moderate-moderate, low-moderate
- Review BIA, PTA

### 21. RMF Step 0 - System level tasks P8-P13
- System level tasks will help you prepare for system security categorization
- Complete PTA and BIA before system categorization is determined
- Identify your system stakeholders
- Collect your system inventory
- Authorization boundary
- Collect all your information types
- Identify the life cycles of all your information types

### 22. FISMA - System and technical description part 1
- Overview of SSP (System Security Plan)
- System Assessment and Authorization (A&A)
  - System name
  - The point of contractors
  - Operational status
  - System categorization

### 23. FISMA - System and technical description part 2
- System environment
- Accreditation boundary: the boundaries that contain network devices under an organization's control
- When two organization share data:
  - Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)
    - Must contain the proof of a current ATO

### 24. FISMA - RMF Step 2 - select security Controls
- NIST 800-53: 1000+ security controls
- Category
  - High
  - moderate
  - Low
  
### 25. Tailoring security controls

### 26. FISMA - RMF Step 3 - implement security controls

### 27. Implementation statement practice 2

### 28. Implementation statement practice 3

### 29. Imp Statement Exercise

### 30. FISMA - PEP Talk! Intro to simulations
