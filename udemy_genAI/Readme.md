35. What are prompts?
- The basic idea behind stable diffusion prompts is to use a large, pre-trained language model as a "prompt" to guide the generaion of image. The prompt is a sequence of words or phrases that provides context and structure for the generated test. The image generator then uses this prompt to produce output that is coherent and consistent with the prompt
